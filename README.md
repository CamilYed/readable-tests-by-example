## Example Domain

A store sells vinyl records. Each order is delivered by a courier company. When the client pays for the order, the
delivery cost is charged. The delivery cost is always getting from the supplier's system (system of courier company). In
the event of its unavailability, the delivery cost is equal to `20 EUR`.

There are two clients in the system: `STANDARD` and `VIP`. If the order is fulfilled for the `VIP` or
the `order value exceeds` the fixed amount according to the promotion price list this order has free delivery.

For `VIP` a free track music should be sent to his mailbox.

`No modifications` can be made after the order has been paid.
